This is my "Simon Game" project for [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-simon-game).

You can [download my adobe XD project file here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7ArzBuNX7W9ZE83WDNyRHJ1Ujg).




Since this is the last project in the advanced front-end projects for freeCodeCamp I have now claimed my [certificate](https://www.freecodecamp.com/brandonbahret/front-end-certification). In total I spent 135 hours and 48 minutes (over a 44 day period) completing the course work. I went into FCC with three years of learning experience, so if that sounds quick that's why.




I did FCC to learn the basics of front-end web-development, and I can say that goal was fulfilled. Now from here I think I'll pick up the basics of back-end development.
